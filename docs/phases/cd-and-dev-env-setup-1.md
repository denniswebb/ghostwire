I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

The project already uses `mise` for task management (`.mise.toml` defines build, test, fmt, vet, lint, clean tasks) and has documented this in `AGENTS.md`. The user wants to add GitHub Actions for CI/CD with local testing via `act`, and specifically requires multi-architecture container images (amd64 and arm64). The web search revealed best practices: use `jdx/mise-action@v2` for tool/task integration, `actions/setup-go@v5` with caching, `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v8` for linting, and Docker Buildx for multi-platform container builds. The project is greenfield with minimal code, making this the ideal time to establish CI/CD patterns before subsequent phases add complexity.

### Approach

Create a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that leverages the existing `mise` tasks, follows Go best practices (test with race detection, lint with golangci-lint, security scanning), and supports local testing via `act`. Add workflows for: (1) CI (test/lint/vet on PR and push), (2) multi-architecture container builds (amd64 and arm64 for future phases), and (3) release automation (placeholder). Configure `act` with sensible defaults for local iteration. Update `AGENTS.md` to document the CI/CD workflow and local testing procedures.

### Reasoning

Listed the repository structure to confirm existing files. Read `AGENTS.md`, `.mise.toml`, and `README.md` to understand the project's tooling choices and task definitions. Searched the web for GitHub Actions best practices with Go (2024/2025), `act` local testing patterns, and `mise-action` integration to ensure the plan follows current standards and avoids deprecated patterns (e.g., artifact actions v3). The user clarified the need for multi-architecture container images (amd64 and arm64).

## Proposed File Changes

### .github(NEW)

Create `.github/` directory to house GitHub-specific configuration (workflows, dependabot, issue templates).

### .github/workflows(NEW)

Create `.github/workflows/` directory for GitHub Actions workflow definitions.

### .github/workflows/ci.yml(NEW)

References: 

- .mise.toml

Create the main CI workflow triggered on `push` to `main` and `pull_request` events. Set concurrency group to `ci-${{ github.ref }}` with `cancel-in-progress: true` to auto-cancel superseded runs. Define a `test` job running on `ubuntu-latest` with steps: (1) `actions/checkout@v4`, (2) `jdx/mise-action@v2` with `install: true`, `cache: true`, and `version: 2024.10.0` (or latest stable), (3) `mise run fmt` to verify formatting (fail if changes detected via `git diff --exit-code`), (4) `mise run vet` for static analysis, (5) `mise run test` with additional flags `-race -shuffle=on -coverprofile=coverage.out` to enable race detection, randomize test order, and generate coverage, (6) `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to upload `coverage.out` with `retention-days: 7`. Add a `lint` job (can run in parallel with `test`) using `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v8` with `version: latest` (or pin a specific version like `v1.61`), `args: --timeout=5m`, and `only-new-issues: false` for full repo linting. Set default permissions to `contents: read` for security hardening. Add env var `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to the mise-action step to avoid rate limits when fetching tools from GitHub releases.

### .github/workflows/build.yml(NEW)

References: 

- .mise.toml

Create a build workflow triggered on `push` to `main`, `pull_request`, and `workflow_dispatch` (for manual runs). Define a `build` job with a matrix strategy covering `os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]` and `go-version: ['1.22', '1.23']` (or just the versions you want to support). Steps: (1) `actions/checkout@v4`, (2) `jdx/mise-action@v2` with `install: true` and `cache: true`, (3) `mise run build` to compile the binary, (4) verify the binary exists and is executable (use conditional checks for Windows vs Unix), (5) `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to upload the compiled binary with a name like `ghostwire-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.go-version }}` and `retention-days: 7`. This validates cross-platform builds and provides downloadable binaries for testing. Set `permissions: contents: read`.

### .github/workflows/container.yml(NEW)

Create a multi-architecture container build workflow (placeholder for future phases when Dockerfile is added). Trigger on `push` to `main` and `pull_request`, plus `workflow_dispatch`. Define a `build-container` job that: (1) checks out code with `actions/checkout@v4`, (2) sets up QEMU with `docker/setup-qemu-action@v3` to enable cross-platform emulation, (3) sets up Docker Buildx with `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3`, (4) logs in to GHCR with `docker/login-action@v3` using `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` (only on push to main, not PRs, controlled by `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'`), (5) extracts metadata with `docker/metadata-action@v5` to generate tags (e.g., `latest`, `sha-<commit>`, semver tags on release) and labels, (6) builds and pushes with `docker/build-push-action@v6` targeting `./build/Dockerfile` (which doesn't exist yetâ€”document this as a placeholder), setting `platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64` for multi-architecture builds, `push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}` to only push on main, `tags` and `labels` from metadata action, `cache-from: type=gha` and `cache-to: type=gha,mode=max` for GitHub Actions cache to speed up builds. Add a comment at the top: `# Placeholder: requires Dockerfile in /build/ directory (added in later phase)`. Set `permissions: contents: read, packages: write` to allow GHCR pushes. Document that the multi-arch build will produce images for both amd64 (x86_64) and arm64 (aarch64) architectures, suitable for Intel/AMD servers and ARM-based systems (AWS Graviton, Apple Silicon, etc.).

### .github/workflows/release.yml(NEW)

References: 

- .mise.toml

Create a release workflow triggered on `push` with `tags: ['v*']` pattern. Define a `release` job that: (1) checks out code with `fetch-depth: 0` for full history, (2) sets up mise and Go, (3) runs `mise run test` to validate the tagged commit, (4) builds binaries for multiple platforms using a matrix or a tool like GoReleaser (document GoReleaser as optional/future enhancement), (5) creates a GitHub release with `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` or similar, attaching the binaries and generating release notes from commits. Add a comment: `# Placeholder: expand with GoReleaser or multi-platform build matrix in later phase`. Set `permissions: contents: write` to allow release creation. Note that this workflow should also trigger the container build workflow to produce multi-arch container images tagged with the release version.

### .github/dependabot.yml(NEW)

Create Dependabot configuration to keep GitHub Actions and Go dependencies up to date. Define two update configurations: (1) `package-ecosystem: github-actions` with `directory: /` and `schedule: interval: weekly` to auto-update action versions, (2) `package-ecosystem: gomod` with `directory: /` and `schedule: interval: weekly` to update Go module dependencies. Set `open-pull-requests-limit: 5` for each to avoid PR spam. Add `groups` to batch minor/patch updates together (e.g., group all GitHub Actions updates into a single PR). This ensures the project stays current with security patches and new features.

### .actrc(NEW)

Create `act` configuration file to set sensible defaults for local GitHub Actions testing. Define: (1) `-P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04` to use a medium-sized runner image with common tools preinstalled (balances size and compatibility), (2) `--container-architecture linux/amd64` for Apple Silicon Macs to avoid architecture mismatches (note: act runs workflows in a single architecture locally; multi-arch builds require Docker Buildx which act supports), (3) `--artifact-server-path .artifacts` to enable local artifact upload/download with actions v4, (4) `--action-offline-mode` to cache action code and avoid re-downloading on every run (speeds up iteration). Add comments explaining each flag and noting that users can override with command-line flags. Document that the `.artifacts/` directory should be added to `.gitignore`. Note that multi-architecture container builds will work in act if Docker Buildx is available, but QEMU emulation may be slow for cross-platform builds.

### .gitignore(MODIFY)

Add entries for `act` artifacts and GitHub Actions local testing: `.artifacts/` (local artifact server directory), `.act/` (act cache directory if used), and any other act-related temporary files. Ensure the existing entries for the compiled binary (`ghostwire`), Go build artifacts (`*.test`, `*.out`), and editor files (`.DS_Store`, `*.swp`) are preserved.

### .golangci.yml(NEW)

References: 

- .mise.toml
- .github/workflows/ci.yml(NEW)

Create golangci-lint configuration file to define linting rules and behavior. Enable a curated set of linters appropriate for a new Go project: `gofmt`, `goimports`, `govet`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `unused`, `gosimple`, `ineffassign`, `typecheck`, `misspell`, `revive` (or `golint` if preferred), `gosec` (security), `gocritic` (style/performance). Configure `linters-settings` to tune specific linters (e.g., `revive` rules, `gosec` exclusions for known-safe patterns). Set `issues.exclude-use-default: false` to see all issues. Add `run.timeout: 5m` and `run.tests: true` to lint test files. Document that this config is used by both the GitHub Actions lint job and local `mise run lint` (which calls `golangci-lint run`).

### AGENTS.md(MODIFY)

References: 

- .actrc(NEW)
- .github/workflows/ci.yml(NEW)
- .github/workflows/build.yml(NEW)
- .github/workflows/container.yml(NEW)

Update the `Workflow Expectations` section to add a new subsection: **4. Continuous Integration & Local Testing.** Document that: (1) All CI/CD runs through GitHub Actions (workflows in `.github/workflows/`), (2) The `ci.yml` workflow runs on every PR and push to main, executing `mise run fmt`, `mise run vet`, `mise run test` (with race detection and coverage), and `golangci-lint`, (3) Developers should test GitHub Actions locally using `act` before pushing (install via `brew install act` or the official installer), (4) Run `act pull_request` to simulate a PR build locally, or `act -j test` to run a specific job, (5) Configuration defaults are in `.actrc` (uses medium Ubuntu image, enables artifacts, caches actions), (6) The `build.yml` workflow validates cross-platform builds, and `container.yml` builds multi-architecture container images (amd64 and arm64) for deployment, (7) `release.yml` is a placeholder for future tagged releases. Add a new section under `Useful Commands` titled **Local CI Testing (via act)** with a table: `act pull_request` (simulate PR CI locally), `act -j test` (run just the test job), `act -j lint` (run just the lint job), `act -l` (list all jobs), `act --artifact-server-path .artifacts` (enable artifact upload/download). Update the `Testing & Validation Strategy` section to mention: Before opening a PR, run `mise run test` and optionally `act pull_request` to catch CI failures early. Update the `Collaboration Tips` section to note: When modifying GitHub Actions workflows, test locally with `act` to avoid push-fix-push cycles. Add a note about multi-architecture container builds: The `container.yml` workflow produces images for both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 platforms, ensuring compatibility with Intel/AMD servers and ARM-based systems (AWS Graviton, Apple Silicon Kubernetes nodes, etc.).

### README.md(MODIFY)

References: 

- .actrc(NEW)
- .github/workflows/ci.yml(NEW)
- .github/workflows/container.yml(NEW)
- AGENTS.md(MODIFY)

Update the `Development` section to add a subsection on CI/CD and local testing. After the existing `mise` task documentation, add: **Continuous Integration:** All code changes are validated by GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/`). The CI pipeline runs tests with race detection, linting with `golangci-lint`, and cross-platform builds. Container images are built for both amd64 and arm64 architectures. **Local Testing:** Use `act` to run GitHub Actions workflows locally before pushing. Install with `brew install act` (macOS) or see [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) for other platforms. Run `act pull_request` to simulate a full PR build, or `act -j test` to run just the test job. Configuration defaults are in `.actrc`. **Pre-commit Checklist:** Before opening a PR, run `mise run fmt`, `mise run vet`, `mise run test`, and optionally `act pull_request` to catch issues early. **Multi-Architecture Support:** Container images are built for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, supporting Intel/AMD servers, AWS Graviton instances, and Apple Silicon-based Kubernetes nodes. This ensures developers understand the CI/CD workflow, multi-arch support, and how to test locally.

Create a dedicated CI/CD documentation file explaining the GitHub Actions setup in detail. Structure: **Overview** (describe the CI/CD philosophy: fast feedback, test before merge, automate releases, multi-architecture support), **Workflows** (list each workflow file with its purpose: `ci.yml` for test/lint, `build.yml` for cross-platform validation, `container.yml` for multi-arch Docker images targeting linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, `release.yml` for tagged releases), **Multi-Architecture Container Builds** (explain the use of Docker Buildx and QEMU for cross-platform builds, the platforms supported, and why this matters for deployment to heterogeneous Kubernetes clusters with both x86 and ARM nodes), **Local Testing with act** (installation instructions, common commands, troubleshooting tips for Docker/Podman, Apple Silicon notes, artifact server setup, note that multi-arch builds work locally if Docker Buildx is configured but may be slow due to QEMU emulation), **Adding New Workflows** (guidelines: use `mise-action` for tool setup, follow security best practices from `AGENTS.md`, test locally with `act` before committing), **Secrets and Variables** (document any required secrets like `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GHCR pushes, explain how to add repo secrets), **Troubleshooting** (common issues: rate limits, cache misses, act image size, Docker context problems, QEMU emulation slowness for cross-platform builds, Buildx setup). Reference the GitHub Actions best practices from the web search (concurrency, caching, security hardening). This provides a single source of truth for CI/CD that both humans and agents can reference.
